            functioning after failure of one or more of the servers</em></span>.</p><p>A part of high availability is <span class="emphasis"><em>failover</em></span> which we define as the
            <span class="emphasis"><em>ability for client connections to migrate from one server to another in event
            of server failure so client applications can continue to operate</em></span>.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="d0e10592"/>39.1. Live - Backup Groups</h2></div></div></div><p>HornetQ allows servers to be linked together as <span class="emphasis"><em>live -
                backup</em></span> groups where each live server can have 1 or more backup servers.
            A backup server is owned by only one live server. Backup servers are not operational until
            failover occurs, however 1 chosen backup, which will be in passive mode, announces its status and waits to take
            over the live servers work</p><p>Before failover, only the live server is serving the HornetQ clients while the backup
            servers remain passive or awaiting to become a backup server. When a live server crashes or is brought down
            in the correct mode, the backup server currently in passive mode will become live and another backup server
        will become passive. If a live server restarts after a failover then it will have priority and be the next server
        to become live when the current live server goes down, if the current live server is configured to allow automatic
        failback then it will detect the live server coming back up and automatically stop.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ha.mode"/>39.1.1. HA modes</h3></div></div></div><p>HornetQ provides only <span class="emphasis"><em>shared store</em></span> in this release. <span class="emphasis"><em>Replication</em></span>

                        <span class="emphasis"><em>same</em></span> entire data directory using a shared file system.
                    This means the paging directory, journal directory, large messages and binding
                    journal.</p><p>When failover occurs and a backup server takes over, it will load the
                    persistent storage from the shared file system and clients can connect to
                    it.</p><p>This style of high availability differs from data replication in that it
                    requires a shared file system which is accessible by both the live and backup
                    nodes. Typically this will be some kind of high performance Storage Area Network
                    (SAN). We do not recommend you use Network Attached Storage (NAS), e.g. NFS
                    mounts to store any shared journal (NFS is slow).</p><p>The advantage of shared-store high availability is that no replication occurs
                    between the live and backup nodes, this means it does not suffer any performance
                    penalties due to the overhead of replication during normal operation.</p><p>The disadvantage of shared store replication is that it requires a shared file
                    system, and when the backup server activates it needs to load the journal from
                    the shared store which can take some time depending on the amount of data in the
                    store.</p><p>If you require the highest performance during normal operation, have access to
                    a fast SAN, and can live with a slightly slower failover (depending on amount of
                    data), we recommend shared store high availability</p><div align="center"><img src="images/ha-shared-store.png" align="middle"/></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ha/mode.shared.configuration"/>39.1.2.1. Configuration</h4></div></div></div><p>To configure the live and backup servers to share their store, configure

                        both servers must have configured the location of journal directory to point
                        to the <span class="emphasis"><em>same shared location</em></span> (as explained in <a class="xref" href="persistence.html#configuring.message.journal" title="15.3. Configuring the message journal">Section 15.3, “Configuring the message journal”</a>)</p><div xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>todo write something about GFS</p></div><p>Also each node, live and backups, will need to have a cluster connection defined even if not
                        part of a cluster. The Cluster Connection info defines how backup servers announce there presence
                        to it's live server or any other nodes in the cluster. refer to <a class="xref" href="clusters.html" title="Chapter 38. Clusters">Chapter 38, <i>Clusters</i></a> for details

                        restart the live server and have clients fail back. To do this simply restart the original live
                        server and kill the new live server. You can do this by killing the process itself or just waiting
                        for the server to crash naturally </p><p>
                        It is also possible to cause failover to occur on normal server shutdown, to enable
                        this set the following property to true in the <code class="literal">hornetq-configuration.xml</code>
                        configuration file like so:
                    </p><pre xmlns="" xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="">
&lt;failover-on-shutdown&gt;true&lt;/failover-on-shutdown&gt;
                    </pre><p>
                        By default this is set to false, if by some chance you have set this to false but still
                        want to stop the server normally and cause failover then you can do this by using the management
                        API as explained at <a class="xref" href="management.html#management.core.server" title="30.1.1.1. Core Server Management">Section 30.1.1.1, “Core Server Management”</a>
                    </p><p>
                        You can also force the new live server to shutdown when the old live server comes back up allowing
                        the original live server to take over automatically by setting the following property in the
                    <code class="literal">hornetq-configuration.xml</code> configuration file as follows:
                    </p><pre xmlns="" xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="">

            same server (e.g. in case of transient network problems). This is similar to failover,
            except it's reconnecting to the same server and is discussed in <a class="xref" href="client-reconnection.html" title="Chapter 34. Client Reconnection and Session Reattachment">Chapter 34, <i>Client Reconnection and Session Reattachment</i></a></p><p>During failover, if the client has consumers on any non persistent or temporary
            queues, those queues will be automatically recreated during failover on the backup node,
            since the backup node will not have any knowledge of non persistent queues.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ha.automatic.failover"/>39.2.1. Automatic Client Failover</h3></div></div></div><p>HornetQ clients can be configured to receive knowledge of all live and backup servers, so
                that in event of connection failure at the client - live server connection, the
                client will detect this and reconnect to the backup server. The backup server will
                then automatically recreate any sessions and consumers that existed on each
                connection before failover, thus saving the user from having to hand-code manual
                reconnection logic.</p><p>HornetQ clients detect connection failure when it has not received packets from
                the server within the time given by <code class="literal">client-failure-check-period</code>
                as explained in section <a class="xref" href="connection-ttl.html" title="Chapter 17. Detecting Dead Connections">Chapter 17, <i>Detecting Dead Connections</i></a>. If the client does not
                receive data in good time, it will assume the connection has failed and attempt
                failover. Also if the socket is closed by the OS, usually if the server process is
                killed rather than the machine itself crashing, then the client will failover straight away.
                </p><p>HornetQ clients can be configured to discover the list of live-backup server groups in a
                number of different ways. They can be configured explicitly or probably the most
                common way of doing this is to use <span class="emphasis"><em>server discovery</em></span> for the
                client to automatically discover the list. For full details on how to configure
                server discovery, please see <a class="xref" href="clusters.html#clusters.server-discovery" title="38.2. Server discovery">Section 38.2, “Server discovery”</a>.
                Alternatively, the clients can explicitly connect to a specific server and download
                the current servers and backups see <a class="xref" href="">???</a>.</p><p>To enable automatic client failover, the client must be configured to allow
                non-zero reconnection attempts (as explained in <a class="xref" href="client-reconnection.html" title="Chapter 34. Client Reconnection and Session Reattachment">Chapter 34, <i>Client Reconnection and Session Reattachment</i></a>).</p><p>By default failover will only occur after at least one connection has been made to
                the live server. In other words, by default, failover will not occur if the client
                fails to make an initial connection to the live server - in this case it will simply
                retry connecting to the live server according to the reconnect-attempts property and
                fail after this number of attempts.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="d0e10735"/>39.2.1.1. Failing over on the Initial Connection</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    Since the client doesn't learn about the full topology until after the first
                    connection is made there is a window where it doesn't know about the backup. If a failure happens at
                    this point the client can only try reconnecting to the original live server. To configure
                    how many attempts the client will make you can set the property <code class="literal">initialConnectAttempts</code>
                    on the <code class="literal">ClientSessionFactoryImpl</code> or <code class="literal">HornetQConnectionFactory</code> or
                    <code class="literal">initial-connect-attempts</code> in xml. The default for this is <code class="literal">0</code>, that
                    is try only once. Once the number of attempts has been made an exception will be thrown.
                </p></div><p>For examples of automatic failover with transacted and non-transacted JMS
                sessions, please see <a class="xref" href="examples.html#examples.transaction-failover" title="11.1.65. Transaction Failover">Section 11.1.65, “Transaction Failover”</a> and <a class="xref" href="examples.html#examples.non-transaction-failover" title="11.1.40. Non-Transaction Failover With Server Data Replication">Section 11.1.40, “Non-Transaction Failover With Server Data Replication”</a>.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ha.automatic.failover.noteonreplication"/>39.2.1.2. A Note on Server Replication</h4></div></div></div><p>HornetQ does not replicate full server state between live and backup servers.
                    When the new session is automatically recreated on the backup it won't have any
                    knowledge of messages already sent or acknowledged in that session. Any
                    in-flight sends or acknowledgements at the time of failover might also be
                    lost.</p><p>By replicating full server state, theoretically we could provide a 100%
                    transparent seamless failover, which would avoid any lost messages or
                    acknowledgements, however this comes at a great cost: replicating the full
                    server state (including the queues, session, etc.). This would require
                    replication of the entire server state machine; every operation on the live
                    server would have to replicated on the replica server(s) in the exact same
                    global order to ensure a consistent replica state. This is extremely hard to do
                    in a performant and scalable way, especially when one considers that multiple
                    threads are changing the live server state concurrently.</p><p>It is possible to provide full state machine replication using techniques such
                    as <span class="italic">virtual synchrony</span>, but this does not scale
                    well and effectively serializes all operations to a single thread, dramatically
                    reducing concurrency.</p><p>Other techniques for multi-threaded active replication exist such as
                    replicating lock states or replicating thread scheduling but this is very hard
                    to achieve at a Java level.</p><p>Consequently it has decided it was not worth massively reducing performance
                    and concurrency for the sake of 100% transparent failover. Even without 100%
                    transparent failover, it is simple to guarantee <span class="italic">once and
                        only once</span> delivery, even in the case of failure, by using a
                    combination of duplicate detection and retrying of transactions. However this is
                    not 100% transparent to the client code.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ha.automatic.failover.blockingcalls"/>39.2.1.3. Handling Blocking Calls During Failover</h4></div></div></div><p>If the client code is in a blocking call to the server, waiting for a response
                    to continue its execution, when failover occurs, the new session will not have
                    any knowledge of the call that was in progress. This call might otherwise hang
                    for ever, waiting for a response that will never come.</p><p>To prevent this, HornetQ will unblock any blocking calls that were in progress
                    at the time of failover by making them throw a <code class="literal">javax.jms.JMSException</code> (if using JMS), or a <code class="literal">HornetQException</code> with error code <code class="literal">HornetQException.UNBLOCKED</code>. It is up to the client code to catch
                    this exception and retry any operations if desired.</p><p>If the method being unblocked is a call to commit(), or prepare(), then the
                    transaction will be automatically rolled back and HornetQ will throw a <code class="literal">javax.jms.TransactionRolledBackException</code> (if using JMS), or a

                    messages sent or acknowledgements have not been lost during the failover.</p><p>Consequently the transaction will be marked as rollback-only, and any
                    subsequent attempt to commit it will throw a <code class="literal">javax.jms.TransactionRolledBackException</code> (if using JMS), or a
                        <code class="literal">HornetQException</code> with error code <code class="literal">HornetQException.TRANSACTION_ROLLED_BACK</code> if using the core

                     The caveat to this rule is when XA is used either via JMS or through the core API.
                     If 2 phase commit is used and prepare has already ben called then rolling back could
                     cause a <code class="literal">HeuristicMixedException</code>. Because of this there may be a
                     chance that any non persistent messages could be lost. To avoid this use persistent
                     messages when using XA. With acknowledgements this is not an issue since they are
                     flushed to the server before prepare gets called.
                  </p></div><p>It is up to the user to catch the exception, and perform any client side local
                    rollback code as necessary. There is no need to manually rollback the session -
                    it is already rolled back. The user can then just retry the transactional
                    operations again on the same session.</p><p>HornetQ ships with a fully functioning example demonstrating how to do this,
                    please see <a class="xref" href="examples.html#examples.transaction-failover" title="11.1.65. Transaction Failover">Section 11.1.65, “Transaction Failover”</a></p><p>If failover occurs when a commit call is being executed, the server, as
                    previously described, will unblock the call to prevent a hang, since no response
                    will come back. In this case it is not easy for the client to determine whether
                    the transaction commit was actually processed on the live server before failure
                    occurred.</p><div xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>
                     If XA is being used either via JMS or through the core API then an <code class="literal">XAException.XA_RETRY</code>
                     is thrown. This is to inform Transaction Managers that a retry should occur at some point. At
                     some later point in time the Transaction Manager will retry the commit. If the original
                     commit hadn't occurred then it will still exist and be committed, if it doesn't exist
                     then it is assumed to have been committed although the transaction manager may log a warning.
                  </p></div><p>To remedy this, the client can simply enable duplicate detection (<a class="xref" href="duplicate-detection.html" title="Chapter 37. Duplicate Message Detection">Chapter 37, <i>Duplicate Message Detection</i></a>) in the transaction, and retry the
                    transaction operations again after the call is unblocked. If the transaction had
                    indeed been committed on the live server successfully before failover, then when
                    the transaction is retried, duplicate detection will ensure that any durable
                    messages resent in the transaction will be ignored on the server to prevent them
                    getting sent more than once.</p><div xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>By catching the rollback exceptions and retrying, catching unblocked calls

                connection failure yourself, and code your own manually reconnection logic in your
                own failure handler. We define this as <span class="emphasis"><em>application-level</em></span>
                failover, since the failover is handled at the user application level.</p><p>To implement application-level failover, if you're using JMS then you need to set
                an <code class="literal">ExceptionListener</code> class on the JMS connection. The <code class="literal">ExceptionListener</code> will be called by HornetQ in the event that
                connection failure is detected. In your <code class="literal">ExceptionListener</code>, you
                would close your old JMS connections, potentially look up new connection factory
                instances from JNDI and creating new connections. In this case you may well be using
                    <a class="ulink" href="http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/JBossHAJNDIImpl">HA-JNDI</a>
                to ensure that the new connection factory is looked up from a different
                server.</p><p>For a working example of application-level failover, please see <a class="xref" href="examples.html#application-level-failover" title="11.1.2. Application-Layer Failover">Section 11.1.2, “Application-Layer Failover”</a>.</p><p>If you are using the core API, then the procedure is very similar: you would set a
                    <code class="literal">FailureListener</code> on the core <code class="literal">ClientSession</code>
                instances.</p></div></div></div><ul class="docnav"><li class="previous"><a accesskey="p" href="clusters.html"><strong>Prev</strong>Chapter 38. Clusters</a></li><li class="up"><a accesskey="u" href="#"><strong>Top of page</strong></a></li><li class="home"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html"><strong>Front page</strong></a></li><li class="next"><a accesskey="n" href="libaio.html"><strong>Next</strong>Chapter 40. Libaio Native Libraries</a></li></ul></body></html>
